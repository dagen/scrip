# SCRIP Application
## A small web application to support SCRIP fundraising

### Overview
The purpose of this application is to provide users with an opportunity to build a collection of scrip cards. This collection of
scrip cards are then emailed to the scrip coordinator so that the cards can be assembled and grouped for the users.

We are not processing payments online as this would cut into the profits earned by the scrip program.  Rather, we are just offering
a convenience mechanism for busy parents to submit scrip orders for pickup at a later time.
